                    <ul>
                        <li>Ranto wins against the avatar who kept missing</li>
                        <li>they steal back hidari&#39;s ring</li>
                        <li>Ahreadbar shows up with this cool talking ruby</li>
                        <li>bella and the seats all show up</li>
                        <li>ezra fight!</li>
                        <li>ranto almost goes into death saves</li>
                        <li>everyone heals up,</li>
                        <li>merlin puts his wizard hat on Haku</li>
                        <li>the seraphim and the other 11 folks in the zodiac show up right outside the goddess tower
                        </li>
                        <li>the gray lady and arosava are fighting and they look equally matched</li>
                        <li>the guardians jump in and migi is conflicted on wether to stay or go</li>
                        <li>Migi ends up recommending kenjin and Sakura go</li>
                        <li>Sakura recommends chicken</li>
                        <li>So the party, kenjin, Chicken, and haku go to the Dark world</li>
                        <li>But instead of the fall that ranto had there&#39;s like a whirlwind of what the Guardians
                            feel all the time<ul>
                                <li>(I&#39;ll probably list what they each called themselves later) - Lauren</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>The party gets to the Dark World and sees it covered in darkness goop and looks totally
                            deserted</li>
                        <li>With wrecked stands and such</li>
                        <li>The party finds this amniotic sac of darkness and pops it</li>
                        <li>And inside is the ophanim</li>
                        <li>But she&#39;s unconscious</li>
                        <li>So obviously ranto kisses her because merlin advised him to</li>
                        <li>It was a shitty kiss</li>
                        <li>And so they take her out of the sac and heal her</li>
                        <li>And she gets very mad at ranto for coming back and they start yelling at each other</li>
                        <li>Ranto saying she fucked everything up and the ophanim saying that it&#39;s not her fault but
                            there was better things to be doing</li>
                        <li>This argument ends and the ophanim warps off to God knows where</li>
                    </ul>
