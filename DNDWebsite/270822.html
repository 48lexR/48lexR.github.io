                        <li>The Ophanim is singing Scarborough Fair, the ball is singing Canticle, over time the ball
                            begins
                            to form and shape into the Seraphim</li>
                        <li>Zorgon tries to persuade the Ophanim to give his half of his soul back</li>

                                <li>The Ophanim stands in the middle of the roof, and starts to sing, we are compelled
                                    to
                                    shut up</li>
                            </ul>

                        <li>The music is almost a counterpart to the Grand Music, Ranto somehow understands it</li>

                        </li>
                        <li>The Seraphim is better and goes in for a hug with the Ophanim, but we hear some kind of
                            crack
                            and the Ophanim drops to her knees and says &quot;Brother, what have they done t* &quot; and
                            is
                            cut off</li>
                        <li>Zorgon sees the Ophanim is complicated and Seraphim ripped through the Ophanim&#39;s power
                            sources but she&#39;s fiiiiiiiiiine</li>
                        <li>Kenjin draws her sword, Zorgon and Ranto take the Ophanim&#39;s body and try to move it off
                            of
                            the roof</li>
                        <li>The party gets to the ground, then goes back up</li>
                        <li>Chicken talks about stopping the Starlight King, Kenjin says &quot;My daughter will meet her
                            godparents&quot;<ul>
                                <li>So Kenjin is pregnant now</li>
                            </ul>

                        <li>Mikey &quot;L fake L synthetic&quot; to the Seraphim</li>
                        <li>The Seraphim goes &quot;Perfect&quot;</li>
                        <li>Og realizes the Seraphim is between what it was programmed to do and how the Ophanim taught
                            it
                            to live</li>
                        <li>Zorgon goes around to the back and sees something in the back of the Seraphim&#39;s back,
                            Chicken whispers to him and Zorgon rips out at a particular bit (taking out as much as he
                            can)
                        </li>
                        <li>The Seraphim goes down like a rock</li>
                        <li>Kenjin and Chicken approach, and they&#39;re intrigued</li>
                        <li>Chicken yells to get rid of it and swipes at it</li>
                        <li>The bit goes flying, Zorgon is mad that Chicken swatted it out of his hand</li>
                        <li>Once the bit hits the ground, the ground rumbles and in the distance we see Gemini</li>
                        <li>Ranto drags the Ophanim back into the temple</li>
                        <li>Chicken hisses back at Zorgon, &quot;Be grateful for once in your life. You think you can
                            use a
                            Star Piece for good?&quot;</li>
                        <li>Zorgon fails an intelligence check</li>
                        <li>Everyone levels up!</li>
