                                    firm in his beliefs, funny, strong, and dilligent. He's no genius, but his strong
                                    suit is strength, anyways. He's an Aasimar Paladin who just hangs around for a good
                                    time.</p>

                                <p><em>Hailey Stuttard plays Merlin Theodore Skog,</em> who is amnesiac dubbed the
                                    &lsquo;Wizard Lizard&rsquo; by those from his past. Merlin began the campaign with a
                                    great
                                    disinterest in his companions and the adventures they were sent on. However, as time
                                    went on, he found there was much more to the others that intrigued him...and
                                    unearthed parts of his past he had long forgotten. Slowly the party members and
                                    their adventures turn the brash, and frankly stupid, Merlin back to the
                                    “endearingly” (subject for debate) awkward scholar he once was. (Yay character

                                <p><em>Micajah Bullard plays Ranto,</em> a half-elf paladin with a chaotic taste for
                                    justice. She&rsquo;s usually pretty stern and focused, so she keeps her eyes on the
                                    prize no matter what, although she's not terribly good at planning. If she had a
                                    motto, it'd be: &lsquo;Never fear, never falter, always fight.&rsquo;</p>
