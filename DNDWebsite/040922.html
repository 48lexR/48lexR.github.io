                            <p>Gemini is approaching quickly, and neither the Ophanim nor the Seraphim are awake to stop
                                it.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Zorgon and Chicken are fixing at the Ophanim. The plan is to defend long enough for the
                                Ophanim to be fixed.</p>
                        </li>

                            <p>Zorgon yells and asks why the &quot;funny people&quot; are running at him. It has to do
                                with &quot;one of you.&quot; (That person dubiously confirmed to be Ranto.)</p>

                        <li>
                            <p>Pegasus persues the party, which flees Eastward, through the ruins of some towns and into
                                a place that feels &quot;eerily familiar.&quot;</p>

                                <li>A grove, and in the center is a small, stone structure in a dome structure. </li>
                                <li>There&#39;s a magically sealed doorway. It&#39;s extremely old and strong. Several
                                    attempts to open the doors are made and the doors magically weakend-ish.</li>
                                <li>She who has swallowed a fallen star/rests here.</li>
                                <li>A creek flows into the tomb of the Pukito (the Creator), and Mikey sticks gauze in
                                    the river that quickly gains moth holes. </li>
                                <li>Ranto knows that Merlin studied this place. It&#39;s the same in the light and dark
                                    world.</li>
                                <li>Pukito was the Creator, and she was the only entity who could manipulate time. When
                                    she died, nobody could manipulate time any more.</li>
                                <li>The seal of Pukito is on the top.</li>
                                <li>Merlin shows up right after Mikey calls Ranto a cuntâ€“Zorgon does acrobatics into the
                                    body bag of holding.</li>
                                <li>Merlin dispells magic on the magical barrier.</li>

                                <li>They arrive at a chamber at the bottom. There&#39;s a table with a sheet on it. A
                                    pedestal stands above where the river ends. Something&#39;s on the pedestal.</li>
                                <li>Writing on the pedestal in an Ancient, Primordial language.<ul>
                                        <li>&quot;This is the remnants of what Pukito once was. It holds time itself.
                                            Time flows on though the goddess is gone.&quot;</li>
                                        <li>&quot;Though knowledge may be granted through what once was, fate like this
                                            tomb shall be set in stone.&quot;</li>

                                        <li>Polaris sheds a tear that drips onto the goddess tower, revealing a giant
                                            dude.</li>
                                        <li>Luna uses &quot;Ethereal Moon&quot; against the goddess tower.</li>

                                <li>Mikey runs up the staircase. Cue: Mikey-Merlin bonding moment.</li>
                                <li>Chicken thought he saw the prima before Bella.<ul>
                                        <li>&quot;Hi Camellia, miss you, Bella&#39;s doing a great job.&quot;</li>

                                        <li>&quot;I guess, in the end, this place has got a lot of nature in it.&quot;
